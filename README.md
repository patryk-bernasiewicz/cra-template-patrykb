# PatrykB's Create React App template

Hello!

This is my first very own CRA template. I figured I spend too much time setting up my React projects from scratch, so I decided to create this template to easily automate some typical tasks that are common in my React projects.

## Tech stack

This template includes following features:

- TypeScript
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Husky
- lint-staged
- Storybook

## Installation

To use this template, simply run this command in your command line tool:

```
yarn create react-app <app-name> --template cra-template-patrykb
```
